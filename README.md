# Outcome

This project showcases the complete workflow of a data analyst — from raw data to actionable insights — using industry-relevant tools and methods.

# Visualization 1

This visualization demonstrates current technology usage trends, highlighting JavaScript, MySQL, Windows, and jQuery as the most widely adopted across languages, databases, platforms, and frameworks. It reflects my ability to perform data wrangling, analysis, and interactive dashboard creation using Python and IBM Cognos Analytics.

# Visualization 2

This visualization highlights future technology preferences, with JavaScript, Python, and TypeScript as the most desired languages, PostgreSQL and MongoDB leading databases, Linux and AWS dominating platform demand, and React.js emerging as the top web framework of choice. It demonstrates my ability to translate survey data into actionable insights using advanced analytics and interactive dashboards.

# Visualization 3

This visualization presents developer demographics, showing a strong male majority among respondents, diverse regional participation across continents, and a concentration of professionals holding bachelor’s and master’s degrees. Age distribution highlights younger groups (18–34) as the most active in the field. These insights demonstrate my ability to analyze and visualize demographic data for meaningful interpretation.
